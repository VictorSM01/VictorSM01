- 👋 Hi, I’m @VictorSM01
- 👀 I’m a scientist with strong background in physics and mathematics. I have over 6 years of experience developing algorithms in various programming languages for solving theoretical and applied physical problems. I am passionate about applying my analytical skills to real world data for finding new efficient solutions to complex problems. My main interests are complex systems, real world data analysis and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for a job in the field of data or image analysis (specially remote sensing data) while expanding my knowledge in machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exiting open source projects related to satellite data. So, if you need a hand, do not hesitate to contact me.
- 📫 You can reach me via my [email](mailto:victormsanmartin1@gmail.com) or through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-san-martin-03b821137/).
